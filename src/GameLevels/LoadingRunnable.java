/**
 * The LoadingRunnable class acts as a Runnable object while also updating the
 * loading screen in the ManagedGameScene class. An ArrayList of
 * LoadingRunnables is present in each ManagedGameScene to give the
 * developer as much or as little control over how much loading progression
 * is shown to the player. It is important to note that while the updating of
 * the loading screen is not processor intensive in MTrakk, a more
 * complicated, graphically complex loading screen may take a large toll
 * on the loading times of each level.
